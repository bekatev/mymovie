MyMovie is a movie discovery platform built using React, Vite, Tailwind CSS, and Firebase. The application allows users to explore popular movies, search for their favorite titles, and view detailed information like synopses, release dates, and ratings. The app fetches movie data using a third-party movie API, providing real-time movie details.
This project demonstrates the integration of React with modern tools and libraries, making it a perfect example of building fast, responsive, and dynamic web applications.

Clicking on a movie will bring up a detailed page with the full description, release date, poster, and rating.

- API Integration:
The app fetches movie data from a third-party movie API, which provides up-to-date information for thousands of movies.

- State Management:
React‚Äôs useState and Firebase are used for managing search results, user authentication status, and movie details.


Technologies Used
- React: JavaScript library for building dynamic user interfaces.
- Vite: Next-generation, fast development tool for React apps.
